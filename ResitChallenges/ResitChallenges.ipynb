    "# Resit for weekly challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "In the resit, you will integrate the knowledge from all programming challenges, focusing on writing functions, data cleaning, data exploration as well as analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resit has three components:\n",
    "1. **Functions**\n",
    "    * Programming: Writing a function that that will include multiple conditions.\n",
    "    * Interpretation: Explaining what you are doing and how the function works. \n",
    "2. **Data cleaning and preparation**\n",
    "    * Programming: Applying multiple data cleaning steps in Python you learned in the tutorial\n",
    "    * Interpretation: Explaining what you are doing and choices made when cleaning the data\n",
    "3. **Data exploration**\n",
    "    * Programming: Applying one of the data exploration and visualisation steps in Python you learned in the tutorial\n",
    "    * Interpretation: Explaining what you are doing and interpreting the results of the data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the resit, we will work with an adjusted version of the dataset we used in week 5. It is a data on U.S. partisan news pages on Facebook. You will analyze if popular pages recieve higher amount of positive reactions on Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming\n",
    "Below, you can find a list of number of fans of Facebook pages. In this section we want you to:\n",
    "* Write a short description of the data in the list (including at least its length, data types of its elements and average number of fans for a page in this list)\n",
    "* Write a function that would use conditions to classify the pages into two categories:\n",
    "    * Unpopular - less than average number of fans\n",
    "    * Popular - average or higher number of fans\n",
    "* Apply the function to the list to create a new list consisting of the categories popular and unpopular. \n",
    "* Save the new list to a txt file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "In your own words, explain what your function does and how you apply it to all elements of the list.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this step, we would like you to:\n",
