    "* This take-home Exam for CCS1 consists of a Jupyter Notebook with 3 questions, including sub-questions (a, b, etc.). Read all the questions carefully. Make sure you save the notebook locally before starting to answer the questions. Rename this file according to the following structure: <br>LastName_Surname_StudentID_Coursename\n",
    "* Fill in your name and student number in the indicated space.\n",
    "* To answer the exam questions, write your answers in this notebook where indicated. The word count for the reflection question is a guideline for how lengthy we expect the answer to be. Take this advice seriously (writing a lot more may result in insufficient time to finish the exam). Remaining below or going over the word count will by itself not lead to a deduction of points.\n",
    "* Answer all questions and check upon completion if you really addressed all (sub-)questions.\n",
    "* Use correct and complete sentences. Poorly or unclearly formulated answers will not be graded.\n",
    "* Make sure to answer all questions in your own words.\n",
    "* Do not provide any irrelevant information. If you provide more answers than instructed, only your first answer will be graded. If your correct answer also includes incorrect or irrelevant elements, these will lead to deduction of points.\n",
    "* You can obtain a maximum of 100 points. The points you can obtain for each question are provided at the respective question.\n",
    "* Re-reading full articles, re-watching the lecture or re-doing the challenges during the assignment will not be possible, due to time restrictions. We advise you to use the materials to look up essential coding details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam consists of three sections:\n",
    "* Reflection (20% of exam grade): in a short reflection, we ask you to think about the use of programming languages for computational communication science.\n",
    "* Programming 1 (30% of exam grade): in this programming task, we ask you to filter a dictionary and write a new dataset.\n",
    "* Programming 2 (50% of exam grade): in this programming task, we ask you to select one research question and answer it through analysing datasets provided by us.\n",
